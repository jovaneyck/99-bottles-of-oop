# 99-bottles-of-oop
Refactoring the 99 bottles song from shameless green to something that is open to the "six-pack requirement".

A C# port of the code from the book [99 bottles of OOP](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/) by [Sandi Metz](https://www.sandimetz.com/) and [Katrina Owen](http://www.kytrinyx.com/).
The change history contains all the micro-commits from line-by-line changes.
